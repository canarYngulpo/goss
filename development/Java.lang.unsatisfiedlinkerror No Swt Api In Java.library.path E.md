# How to Fix Java.lang.unsatisfiedlinkerror No Swt Api In Java.library.path e
 
If you are a Java developer, you might have encountered the error `java.lang.unsatisfiedlinkerror No Swt Api In Java.library.path e` when trying to run an application that uses the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) library. This error means that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) cannot find the native libraries that SWT depends on. In this article, we will explain what causes this error and how to fix it.

## What is SWT and why does it need native libraries?
 
SWT is a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for Java that provides a native look and feel for different platforms. Unlike other Java GUI toolkits such as Swing or AWT, SWT does not use its own graphics engine but relies on the operating system's native widgets. This means that SWT needs to access the native libraries of the platform, such as `swt-win32.dll` for Windows or `libswt-gtk.so` for Linux.
 
## What causes the error java.lang.unsatisfiedlinkerror No Swt Api In Java.library.path e?
 
The error java.lang.unsatisfiedlinkerror No Swt Api In Java.library.path e occurs when the JVM cannot find the native libraries that SWT needs. This can happen for several reasons:

- The native libraries are missing from the classpath or the system path.
- The native libraries are incompatible with the JVM version or the platform architecture.
- The native libraries are corrupted or damaged.

## How to fix the error java.lang.unsatisfiedlinkerror No Swt Api In Java.library.path e?
 
To fix the error java.lang.unsatisfiedlinkerror No Swt Api In Java.library.path e, you need to make sure that the JVM can locate and load the native libraries that SWT requires. Here are some steps that you can follow:

1. Download and install the correct version of SWT for your platform and JVM from [https://www.eclipse.org/swt/](https://www.eclipse.org/swt/). You can also use a dependency management tool such as Maven or Gradle to include SWT in your project.
2. Add the SWT jar file and the native libraries to your classpath. You can do this by using the `-cp` or `-classpath` option when running your application from the command line, or by setting the `CLASSPATH` environment variable. Alternatively, you can use the `-Djava.library.path` option to specify the directory where the native libraries are located.
3. If you are using an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, make sure that you configure your project settings to include SWT in your build path and run configurations. You can also use a plugin such as [SWT Designer](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/swt-designer) or [WindowBuilder](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-windowbuilder) to create and edit SWT GUIs in your IDE.
4. If none of the above steps work, try to update your JVM to the latest version or switch to a different JVM vendor. You can also check if there are any known issues or bugs related to SWT on your platform and apply any patches or workarounds if available.
